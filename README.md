# Rock_Paper_Scissor_Game
Write a python program for the Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard game

The rules of the game are:
Spock beats scissors and rock, but loses to paper and lizard.
Lizard beats Spock and paper, but loses to rock and scissors.
Rock beats scissors and lizard, but loses to paper and Spock.
Paper beats rock and Spock, but loses to scissors and lizard.
Scissors beats paper and lizard, but loses to rock and Spock.
